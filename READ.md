# Webscraping Project

In this project I mainly focused on webscraping by usinig the ```beatifulsoup``` python library, and the ```requests``` method. The data revolved around house prices. I tried
to scrape data from the ```wwww.zillow.com``` website.
The second part of the project was automating the process of filling out a form, that saves information into a Google Sheet. This automation was done by using the help of
```Selenium```.
